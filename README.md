Dictionary using C
===============

This program just uses "strstr" function to look up the word in a file and display its meaning. The file contains about 50,000 word meanings. 

PS: The file "Ox" is needed in the same directory for the source to run. The Executable file "Dictionary.exe" is bundled with this file via 'iExpress for Windows' and doesn't need it.
